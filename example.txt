arbitrary observable of interest on steady state of Lindbladian dynamics.illustrate our method on series of many-body systems including one-dimensional chain and two-dimensional ladder and benchmark

methods.I.INTRODUCTION Open quantum systems which interact continuously with their surrounding environment are fundamental to understanding vast array of physical phenomena and technological applications including quantum op-tics condensed matter physics and quantum informa-tion processing [1–3].These interactions often lead to dissipative dynamics that can significantly alter sys-tem’s behavior over time.Accurately determining steady-state properties of such systems is crucial for pre-dicting long-term behavior and for design of quantum devices that can operate reliably under real-world condi-tions [4 5].From general perspective there has been increasing recent interest [6] in finding techniques to compute stationary state and its properties [7–9] especially with variational methods [10–13].There is attention on characterizing multiple steady states [14 15] and design-ing Lindblad generators for target steady states [16 17].On experimental side an increasing effort was de-voted to demonstrate stable quantum-correlated many-body states [18] steady-state superradiance in free space [19] and propose Dicke superradiant enhancement of heat current in circuit QED [20].common framework for modeling dynamics of open quantum systems is through Lindblad master equation [21 22] ˙ ρ = L ( ρ )  (1) which provides Markovian description of time evo-lution of system’s density matrix [3 23].Lind-bladian superoperator has form L ( ρ ) = − i [ H ρ ] + X i γ i ␒ L i ρL † i − 1 2 n L † i L i  ρ o ␓  (2) which encapsulates both unitary evolution governed by system’s Hamiltonian and dissipative pro-cesses arising from environmental interactions.Finding steady state ρ ss  involves solving for density ma-trix that remains static under Lindbladian dynamics L ( ρ ss ) = 0 .(3) exact computation of steady state and therefore all its properties is in principle possible [24] but soon becomes intractable when increasing system size as number of parameters needed to specify it grows ex-ponentially with number of particles.In fact situation is harder than what observed for other rele-vant many-body problems such as computation of ground states as here one has to deal with mixed states.To reach larger sizes one usually employs variational ap-proaches such as tensor network methods [25] that ap-proximate steady state.Unfortunately these meth-ods do not provide any rigorous result about how close estimated state is to unknown steady state.In many situations however having full description of steady state that is of all parameters needed for its specification is not needed as one is interested in determination of few physical observables of rele-vance.Determining complete state may in fact be too demanding task if in end one is only going to be able to compute polynomially growing number of parameters.It may then be more practical to search for methods that target observable(s) of interest with-out requiring full reconstruction or approximation of steady state. follow this ap-proach and provide scalable method to derive rigorous bounds on any observable of interest at steady state of open-system dynamics described by Lindblad mas-ter equation.To do so exploit relaxations for poly-nomial optimisation introduced in context of quan-tum information theory [26–28] which make use of semi-definite programming (SDP).apply our approach to few paradigmatic models and compare them with tensor-network methods seeing that they attain similar perfor-mance but with rigorous certificates something difficult arXiv:2410.13646v1 [quant-ph] 17 Oct 2024 2 to obtain in variational methods [29].Furthermore while variational methods generally require steady state to be unique [13] our approach applies beyond this instance providing bounds over whole convex set of steady states.rest of manuscript is organized as follows.introduce our SDP method in Sec.II showing par-ticular examples of constraints and presenting general moment-based formulation of optimization problem.In Sec.III apply SDP method to bound different quantities of interest in equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady state configurations of many-body systems.Our conclusions are reported in Sec.IV together with pos-sible future developments.code for this project is open-source available at Ref.[30].II.BOUNDING OBSERVABLES AS AN OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM considered scenario consists of an open-system dy-namics described by Lindbladian superoperator L as in Eq.(2).are then interested in bounding ex-pectation value of an observable O for steady state of system i.e.minimizing/maximizing tr ( Oρ ) when L ( ρ ) = 0 .Since this is linear in ρ  combined with fact that density matrix should be positive one can quite naturally formulate such problem as an SDP.full optimisation however would require an explicit form of ρ  which scales exponentially with number of con-stituents n  typically qubits.To avoid exponential growth in what follows restrict positivity constraints to moment matrices made of subsets of all possible n -qubit operators.While operators to construct moment matrices are arbitrary very natural choice for n -qubit systems consists of “Pauli strings” made of tensor products of Pauli matri-ces for each qubit.will use nota-tion as follows: ⟨ X 1 Y 2 ⟩ for 3-qubit system refers to tr (( σ x ⊗ σ y ⊗ I ) ρ )  where σ x and σ y are Pauli matri-ces acting on first and second qubits respectively.A.Moment matrix positivity constraint Moment matrices have long tradition in quantum in-formation theory.For given state ρ and set of operators { X i }  can define as corresponding moment ma-trix with elements ij := tr( ρX † i X j ) .(4) It can be shown [26] that such moment matrix is pos-itive semidefinite for any choice of operators { X i } .An example of such moment matrix constraint is =          1 ⟨ X 1 ⟩ ⟨ Y 1 ⟩ ⟨ Z 1 ⟩ ⟨ X 2 ⟩ ⟨ Y 2 ⟩ ⟨ Z 2 ⟩ ⟨ X 1 ⟩ 1 − i ⟨ Z 1 ⟩ i ⟨ Y 1 ⟩ ⟨ X 1 X 2 ⟩ ⟨ X 1 Y 2 ⟩ ⟨ X 1 Z 2 ⟩ ⟨ Y 1 ⟩ i ⟨ Z 1 ⟩ 1 − i ⟨ X 1 ⟩ ⟨ Y 1 X 2 ⟩ ⟨ Y 1 Y 2 ⟩ ⟨ Y 1 Z 2 ⟩ ⟨ Z 1 ⟩ − i ⟨ Y 1 ⟩ i ⟨ X 1 ⟩ 1 ⟨ Z 1 X 2 ⟩ ⟨ Z 1 Y 2 ⟩ ⟨ Z 1 Z 2 ⟩ ⟨ X 2 ⟩ ⟨ X 2 X 1 ⟩ ⟨ X 2 Y 1 ⟩ ⟨ X 2 Z 1 ⟩ 1 − i ⟨ Z 2 ⟩ i ⟨ Y 2 ⟩ ⟨ Y 2 ⟩ ⟨ Y 2 X 1 ⟩ ⟨ Y 2 Y 1 ⟩ ⟨ Y 2 Z 1 ⟩ i ⟨ Z 2 ⟩ 1 − i ⟨ X 2 ⟩ ⟨ Z 2 ⟩ ⟨ Z 2 X 1 ⟩ ⟨ Z 2 Y 1 ⟩ ⟨ Z 2 Z 1 ⟩ − i ⟨ Y 2 ⟩ i ⟨ X 2 ⟩ 1          ≽ 0 .(5) refer to this as level 1 moment matrix as top row (or left column) contains only first-order expec-tation values.level 2 moment matrix would contain all first-and second-order expectation values as top row and so on.Here use commutation rules between different sites (i.e.[ X i  X j ] = 0 for i ̸ = j ) as well as Pauli reduction rules ( X i X i = I  X i Y i = iZ i  etc.) to simplify matrix.In general size of moment matrix of level k grows like n k  polynomially with number of qubits.B.Linear Lindbladian constraints Whilst moment matrix optimisation has been well doc-umented in literature [31 32] including case of bounding observables for many-body ground states [33] case of steady-state optimisation offers an extra set of constraints.Based on definition of steady state have extra constraint from Eq.(3) that Lind-bladian acting on our state should be zero.Converting this to expectation values this implies that all (time-independent) observables have constant expectation val-ues at steady state.can change to using adjoint Lindbladian [3] in order to derive constraints as moments of observables acting on ρ .Considering generic operator and definition of adjoint Lindbladian L † have that 0 = tr ( L ( ρ ss )) = tr
